In this project I made in Coppelia robot that is working at industrial line.
3 kinds of parts are spawning on the conveyor that delivers the parts to the robot.
The task is to sort the parts and put them on the correct conveyor.
Each kind of part has its own conveyor.
Robot can identify the parts by the color of the parts.
