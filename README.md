In this project I made in Coppelia robot that is working at industrial line. <br />
3 kinds of parts are spawning on the conveyor that delivers the parts to the robot. <br />
The task is to sort the parts and put them on the correct conveyor. <br />
Each kind of part has its own conveyor. <br />
Robot can identify the parts by the color of the parts. <br />
